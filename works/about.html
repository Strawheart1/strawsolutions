          We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments.
          We only work on a few products and we strive to make them great.

        <p>
          Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
          people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned
          that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are
          richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set
          of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion
          and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

            If you're joining us in Nigeria, we'll help with relocation and
            paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free German or English
            lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive
            health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous
            maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s
            not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout
            the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group
            activities.
